Cuprate is an alternative [Monero](https://getmonero.org) node implementation that independently validates consensus rules, providing a layer of security and redundancy for the network. It is focused on being fast, user-friendly, and backwards compatible with [`monerod`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero).

This project is currently a work-in-progress; documentation will be changing/unfinished and the `cuprated` node itself is not yet production ready.

Feel free to join our Matrix channel or read our [documentation](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation) to learn more.
